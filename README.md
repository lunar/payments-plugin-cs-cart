# Lunar Online Payments for CS-Cart

## Supported CS-Cart versions
*The plugin has been tested with most versions of CS-Cart at every iteration. We recommend using the latest version of CS-Cart, but if that is not possible for some reason, test the plugin with your CS-Cart version and it would probably function properly.*

## Installation

  Once you have installed CS-Cart, follow these simple steps:
  1. Signup at [lunar.app](https://lunar.app) (itâ€™s free)
  1. Create an account
  1. Create an app key for your CS-Cart website
  1. Upload the plugin zip (`lunar_0.0.0.zip`) trough the Add-ons panel and activate it (0.0.0 it's a version example)
  1. Under Administration -> payment methods create a new payment method and select Lunar as the processor.
  1. On the configure tab, insert the app key and your public key in the settings for the Lunar payment gateway you just created
  

## Updating settings

Under the CS-Cart Lunar payment method settings, you can:
 * Add test/live keys
 * Update the shop title that shows up in the hosted checkout page 
 * Change the Checkout Mode (Instant/Delayed)
 * Update the order status that trigger capture, void and what status the order gets in delayed mode
 
 ## How to
 
 1. Capture
 * In Instant mode, the orders are captured automatically
 * In delayed mode you can capture an order by moving the order to the completed/shipped status from processing. (This is based on your settings for the payment method) 
 2. Refund
   * For captured orders there is a refund button in the order details sidebar. Click and you will be able to refund an amount you can configure.
 3. Void
   * To void an order you can move the order into cancelled status. (This is based on your settings for the payment method)
